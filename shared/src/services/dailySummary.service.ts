 * sales and total spend on that day... should be saved."
 *
 * Order of operations matters: the increment-merge into `dailySummaries`
 * happens before any delete. Re-running this before a previous run's
 * deletes finished would double-count that day (a real but small window —
 * both steps are plain awaited calls, no transaction ties them together;
 * same best-effort standard pruneOldOrders itself already accepted rather
 * than a hard guarantee, which would need a still-absent Cloud Function).
 * Once a doc is deleted it can never be summed again, which is what keeps
 * a normal (non-crashing) run exactly-once even without one.
